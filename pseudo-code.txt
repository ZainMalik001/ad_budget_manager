Key Logic
Tracking Spend

Increment daily_spend and monthly_spend as ads run.
    Budget Enforcement

If daily_spend ≥ daily_budget or monthly_spend ≥ monthly_budget, deactivate campaign.
    Dayparting Check

Campaigns should only be active during start_time ≤ now ≤ end_time
    Resets

Daily at midnight → reset daily_spend
Monthly (1st of month) → reset monthly_spend
